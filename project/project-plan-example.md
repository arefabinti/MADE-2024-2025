# Project Plan

## Title
Analyzing Bike-Sharing Demand in North American Cities: The Role of Climate Impact on Urban Mobility.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
In what ways do climate factors—such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed—shape bike rental demand and impact urban mobility patterns in North America?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Urban bike-sharing systems are transforming city transportation by offering eco-friendly, carbon-reducing alternatives that curb fossil fuel reliance. Systems like Capital Bikeshare and Seoul Bike Sharing highlight this trend, emphasizing the need to understand what drives bike rental demand. This study analyzes key weather factors—temperature, humidity, and wind speed—using datasets from two cities across different countries to uncover patterns in bike rentals. Our aim is to develop a predictive model for daily or hourly demand, offering actionable insights for enhancing bike-sharing efficiency, ensuring availability, and supporting sustainable urban mobility

## Datasources
