# Project Plan

## Title
Analysis of Traffic Volume and Population Trends in New York City 
## Main Question

1. How do population trends impact traffic volume across bridge crossings and roadways in New York City?

## Description

This project explores how changes in New York City's population affect traffic volume across bridges and roads. Using data from the NYC Department of Transportation, weâ€™ll compare traffic counts with population trends to find patterns and understand how population shifts influence traffic. The findings will help city planners and officials make better decisions for managing traffic and improving city transportation.
